To compile:
    make;
To compile extra credit version:
    make EXTRA_CREDIT=1;

Usage:
    ./elevator [options] < <path to input file>
Options:
    -f<number of floors>
    -p<number of people>
    -w<max wander time>

Notes:
- All functionality described in the PDF is implimented
- Valgrind reports 2 suppressed errors from libpthread, unable to fix
- Because my elevator moves floors before printing whose waiting, a
  person waiting on floor 0 may be reported as waiting after they've
  boarded the elevator, but are still on floor 0.
- The extra credit version is implimented separately from the main
  version using macro #ifdef's and can be built by passing the flag
  -DEXTRA_CREDIT to gcc, or setting the environment variable
  EXTRA_CREDIT to anything.
