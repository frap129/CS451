To compile:
    make;

Usage:
    ./allocator <Total memory size>

Notes:
- All functionality described in the PDF is implimented
- Valgrind reports suppressed errors from libc (bug in version 2.30),
  program still works.
- Requesting more than one block for the same process will create a
  new block rather than increasing the size of the existing block.
  Release will release the first block with that process number.
