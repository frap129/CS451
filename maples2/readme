To compile for debugging:
    gcc sched.c timer.c parser.c -g -Wall -Wextra -o sched
    gcc child.c -lm -g -Wall -Wextra -o child

To compile:
    gcc sched.c timer.c parser.c -o sched
    gcc child.c -lm -o child

Usage:
    ./sched <path to input file>

Notes:
    - All features described in prioritySchedulingWithRealTimer2018.pdf are implimented
    - Timer is impimented as described in lab
    - Prime number checking is implimented similarly to sample_prime.c
    - Since the exact line spacing of the input file wasn't specified, I assumed 50 chars max.
    - Valgrind was used to check for unreported errors and memory leaks
